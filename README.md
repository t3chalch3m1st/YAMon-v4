What is YAMon?
It is a tool that reports usage for every device connecting to your router. Traffic can be rolled-up into arbitrary logical groupings (e.g., by family or roommate name, by device location or function, etc.) A rich and robust set of features and reports driven by an active user-base.

Why YAMon?
Are you trying to figure out why you are exceeding your month usage cap?
Are you trying to figure out who is hogging all of your data?
Are you sure your kids are shutting off their devices at bedtime?
That's why!! More info: http://usage-monitoring.com/about.php
